<h1> Introduction: Frankfurt Rent Analysis Project</h1>
<h5> By Thomas ZÃ¶llinger </h5>
<div class="gap-10"></div>
<h4> For this project almost 15,000 shared apartment advertisements have been scraped from from the web in order to
    be analysed. After filtering out some of the outliers, currently {{'{0:,}'.format(len)}} listings are being used.
    Most of the advertisements are not active anymore, so some of the data is incomplete. For example
    the start and the end of the rent is not shown anymore. However we can still gather a lot of insights from the
    inactive advertisements as well. The main goal of this project is to analyse what drives rents and see if we can
    create a sufficient model in order to predict it.</h4>
