<h1> Introduction: Frankfurt Rent Prediction Project</h1>
<h5> By Thomas ZÃ¶llinger </h5>
<div class="gap-10"></div>
<h4> For this project {{'{0:,}'.format(len)}} shared apartment advertisements have been scraped from the web in order to be analysed
    afterwards. Most of the advertisements are not active anymore, so some of the date is incomplete. For example
    the start and the end of the rent is not shown anymore. However we can still gather a lot of insights from the
    inactive advertisements as well. The main goal of this project is to analyse what drives rents and see if we can
    create a sufficient model in order to predict it.</h4>
